# Google API Ruby Client (0.8.x) Samples

This repository contained contributed samples for an outdated version (0.8.x)
of the [google-api-client](https://rubygems.org/gems/google-api-client) Ruby
gem. They are not compatible with the current client library, and so have
been deleted to avoid confusion.

Updated samples for current versions may be found in the library repository
at https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-ruby-client/tree/master/samples
